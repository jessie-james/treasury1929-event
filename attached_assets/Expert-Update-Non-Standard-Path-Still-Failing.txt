EXPERT UPDATE: Non-Standard Path Attempted - Still No Success
==============================================================

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED: Your Solution B (Non-Standard Path)

Dear Expert,

I implemented your Solution B exactly as recommended, but we're still experiencing the same issue. Here's what I tried:

## üîß WHAT I IMPLEMENTED:

### Complete Non-Standard Path Implementation
```typescript
// In server/index.ts - BEFORE any other middleware
app.post('/booking-direct', async (req, res) => {
  console.log('üü¢ DIRECT BOOKING ROUTE - NO VITE INTERFERENCE POSSIBLE');
  
  try {
    if (!req.isAuthenticated()) {
      res.writeHead(401, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
      return res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: "Unauthorized" }));
    }

    const bookingData = {
      eventId: req.body.eventId,
      userId: req.body.userId,
      tableId: req.body.tableId,
      partySize: req.body.seatNumbers?.length || req.body.partySize || 2,
      customerEmail: req.body.customerEmail,
      stripePaymentId: req.body.stripePaymentId,
      guestNames: req.body.guestNames || [],
      foodSelections: req.body.foodSelections || [],
      status: 'confirmed'
    };

    console.log('üü¢ CREATING BOOKING WITH DIRECT ROUTE:', JSON.stringify(bookingData, null, 2));
    const newBooking = await storage.createBooking(bookingData);
    console.log('üü¢ DIRECT BOOKING CREATED SUCCESSFULLY:', newBooking.id);
    
    // Used writeHead and end for maximum control
    res.writeHead(200, {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Cache-Control': 'no-cache'
    });
    res.end(JSON.stringify({
      success: true,
      message: 'Booking created successfully',
      booking: newBooking
    }));
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('üî¥ DIRECT BOOKING ERROR:', error);
    res.writeHead(500, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
    res.end(JSON.stringify({
      success: false,
      message: 'Booking creation failed',
      error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)
    }));
  }
});
```

### Frontend Updated
```typescript
// Changed to use the non-standard path
const bookingUrl = `${baseUrl}/booking-direct`;
const response = await apiRequest("POST", bookingUrl, booking);
```

## üö´ CRITICAL FINDING: No Server Logs At All

### The Issue:
- **Frontend Log**: `["API Request: POST /booking-direct"]`
- **Backend Log**: **COMPLETE SILENCE** - No "DIRECT BOOKING ROUTE" message appears
- **Pattern**: The endpoint isn't being hit AT ALL

### Evidence:
1. ‚úÖ Payment processing works (shows in logs)
2. ‚úÖ Other `/api/*` endpoints work fine
3. ‚ùå `/booking-direct` endpoint: **ZERO LOGS**
4. ‚ùå Frontend still gets parsing error (HTML instead of JSON)

## üîç DEEP ANALYSIS: The Request Never Reaches Express

### Key Insight:
The frontend shows `POST /booking-direct` but there's **no corresponding server log**. This means:

1. **Request is being intercepted BEFORE reaching Express**
2. **Something is serving HTML response instead**
3. **The route handler never executes**

### Server Order in index.ts:
```typescript
1. CORS setup
2. express.json() middleware
3. Basic endpoints (/api/health)
4. Our new /booking-direct endpoint ‚úÖ (should run)
5. Performance middleware
6. Auth setup
7. Route registration
8. Vite setup (conditionally)
```

## ü§î EXPERT: What's Intercepting Non-API Routes?

Since even `/booking-direct` (completely outside `/api` namespace) is being intercepted:

### Questions for Expert:

1. **Vite Catch-All Scope**: Could Vite be intercepting ALL routes, not just `/api/*`?

2. **Middleware Order**: Is there hidden middleware running before our route registration?

3. **Alternative Solution A**: Should we try your **different port strategy** (separate API server on port 3001)?

4. **Response Debugging**: Should we add the debugging middleware you suggested?

## üéØ REQUESTED EXPERT GUIDANCE:

### Immediate Action Needed:
Since Solution B (non-standard path) failed, what should we try next?

### Specific Options:
A. **Solution A**: Separate port strategy (3001 for API)
B. **Solution C**: Force response headers middleware
C. **Solution D**: Environment variable override
D. **Debugging**: Add response interception logging

### Most Urgent Question:
**What could be intercepting `/booking-direct` requests before they reach Express?**

The fact that absolutely no server logs appear suggests something is handling these requests at a very low level, possibly before Express even processes them.

EXPERT: What's the next most reliable approach to guarantee our booking endpoint works?
