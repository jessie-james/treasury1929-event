### Pricing Configuration Verified

- **Food Service:** Included ✅

### Schedule Configuration ✅
All events configured with identical schedule:
```json
[
  {"time": "5:45 PM", "note": "Doors open; seating; beverage service; amuse-bouche"},
  {"time": "6:30 PM", "note": "First musical performance (30 min)"},
  {"time": "7:00 PM", "note": "Dinner service (salad, pre-selected entrée, dessert)"},
  {"time": "8:15 PM", "note": "Second musical performance (30 min)"},

]
```

### Event Notes Added ✅
- **Alcohol Notes:** "Wine bottles purchasable in-app; glasses of wine, beer, cocktails at the table."
- **Menu Notes:** "Grilled King Salmon — mushroom, tomato, caper, fresh thyme sauce served with scalloped potatoes."

## Phase 2: UI Price Phrase Enforcement ✅

### Price Display Logic Verified
The `formatPriceDisplay()` function in `client/src/lib/price.ts` correctly prioritizes custom `priceDisplay` field, ensuring September events show the complete phrase instead of calculated "$130 per guest" format.

**Implementation:** Events with custom `priceDisplay` field bypass price calculation and display the exact database value.

## Phase 3: Menu System Integration ✅

### Grilled King Salmon Added
- **Menu Item ID:** 50
- **Name:** Grilled King Salmon
- **Description:** "mushroom, tomato, caper, fresh thyme sauce served with scalloped potatoes."
