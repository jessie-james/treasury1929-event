## Recent Updates (August 2025)

### CRITICAL Double-Booking Vulnerability RESOLVED (August 5, 2025)

#### MAJOR SECURITY ISSUE: Frontend Override Bypassing Real-Time Status (RESOLVED)
- **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Frontend was completely overriding backend's real-time booking status calculation
- **Root Cause**: Two-part system failure:
  1. **Backend**: Venue-layouts route hardcoded `status: 'available'` for all tables at line 4225
  2. **Frontend**: IframeSeatSelection component overrode all backend status with local logic at line 419
- **Security Impact**: 
  - Tables showed as "available" (green) even when already booked
  - Multiple customers could book the same table simultaneously
  - Real-time booking status completely bypassed
  - Tables 11 and 16 confirmed affected (showed green when booked)
- **Complete Resolution**:
  - **Backend Fix**: Replaced hardcoded status with `storage.getTablesByVenue(venueId, eventId)` real-time calculation
  - **Frontend Fix**: Removed status override, now respects backend's `table.status === 'booked'` data
  - **Verification**: Tables 11 and 16 now correctly show as red (unclickable) when booked
  - **Production Ready**: Double-booking prevention now fully operational

#### Previous Payment and Booking Flow Bug Resolution (August 5, 2025)

#### MAJOR ISSUE: Complete Booking System Bypass After Payment (RESOLVED)
- **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Customers charged via Stripe but entire booking system bypassed
- **Full Impact**: 
  - No booking records created in database
  - No confirmation emails sent to customers
  - No seat availability updates (tables still show available)
  - No food/wine orders recorded from payment metadata  
  - No table status changes (remained bookable)
- **Root Cause**: Stripe webhook only handling `payment_intent.succeeded` events, missing `checkout.session.completed` events containing booking metadata
- **Complete Resolution**:
  - Enhanced webhook to process `checkout.session.completed` events with full booking creation
  - Integrated automatic availability sync after every booking creation
  - Added email confirmation with QR codes to webhook flow
  - Created recovery endpoint `/api/admin/recover-booking` for missing bookings
  - Added system-wide availability sync endpoint `/api/admin/sync-all-availability`
  - Fixed all field mapping errors and data flow integration
  - All booking endpoints now trigger availability updates automatically

#### Previous Payment Calculation Bug (August 5, 2025) 
- **RESOLVED**: Payment calculation bug causing customer overcharges
- **Customer Impact**: vivacedan@comcast.net was overcharged $46 ($176 charged instead of $130 expected)
- **Resolution**: Fixed payment calculation to use total amount with quantity=1
- **Payment Details**: Stripe Charge ch_3RsfBuEOOtiAoFkb1ZRCy2s1, Refund ID: re_3RsfBuEOOtiAoFkb1oa0MNHk

### Critical Booking Integrity Fix (August 5, 2025)
- **RESOLVED: Double Booking Prevention**: Fixed table status synchronization to prevent multiple customers from booking the same table
- **RESOLVED: Seat Hold Timer Integration**: Tables now properly show as "hold" (orange) during 20-minute booking timer, preventing conflicts
- **RESOLVED: Real-time Status Calculation**: Venue layout now calculates table status based on both confirmed bookings AND active seat holds
- **Enhanced Canvas Rendering**: Updated frontend to display 'booked' tables as red and 'hold' tables as orange for clear visual distinction
- **Database Sync Implementation**: Added real-time status calculation that checks confirmed bookings and active seat holds with expiry validation

### Complete End-to-End Testing (August 5, 2025)
- Completed comprehensive test of the entire booking system from account creation to email confirmation
- **Test Account**: Created jose@sahuaroworks.com with customer role and profile data
- **Booking Test**: Successfully created booking ID #16 with randomized test data:
  - Table #11 (4-seat capacity, Main Floor) for party of 3 guests
  - Randomized guest names: Jose Santos, Maria Rodriguez, Carlos Thompson
  - Complete food selections for each guest across salads, entrees, and desserts
  - Wine selections: Sterling Cabernet and Twenty Acres Chardonnay
  - Database booking creation with proper foreign key relationships

- **Time Format Standardization**: Corrected time display to show "Guest Arrival 5:45 PM, show starts 6:30 PM" format (arrival time calculated as 45 minutes before show time)
- **Email Template Cleanup**: Removed PDF download buttons from all email templates while preserving download functionality in the app interface
- **Email Client Compatibility**: Resolved QR code display issues by using attachment-based approach instead of data URLs
