## Current Status ✅ RESOLVED

The customer **DID** have a booking created properly - the system was working! Here's what actually happened:

### Customer's Booking Details (ID #121)
- **Email**: vivacedan@comcast.net
- **Booking Created**: August 5, 2025 at 7:21 AM
- **Table**: Table #7 (capacity 4, party of 1)
- **Event**: "Pianist Sophia Su in Concert with Clarinetist"
- **Payment ID**: pi_3RsfBuEOOtiAoFkb1uMPg8Yv
- **Food Selections**: Salad #40, Entree #44, Dessert #46

### What Happened
1. **Booking Created Successfully** ✅ - System worked correctly
2. **Payment Calculation Error** ⚠️ - Customer overcharged $176 instead of $130
3. **Full Refund Processed** ✅ - $176 refunded (split into $46 + $130.01)
4. **Booking Cancelled** ✅ - Due to refund, booking marked as cancelled

### Refund Details

- **Full Refund**: $130.01 (re_3RsfBuEOOtiAoFkb1sNDycph) for remaining balance
- **Total Refunded**: $176 (full amount)

## Root Cause: Payment Calculation Bug (Already Fixed)
The original issue was NOT a missing booking - it was a payment calculation error that led to a refund and cancellation.

## Actions Available

### 1. Resend Confirmation Email (Just Completed ✅)
```bash
curl -X POST /api/admin/resend-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "vivacedan@comcast.net"}'
```
**Status**: Completed successfully (200 response)

### 2. If Customer Wants to Rebook
Since they received a full refund, they would need to create a new booking if they still want to attend.

### 3. Reactivate Cancelled Booking (If Appropriate)
If the customer wants their original booking back without repayment:
```bash
curl -X POST /api/admin/recover-booking \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bookingId": 121, "reactivate": true}'
```
