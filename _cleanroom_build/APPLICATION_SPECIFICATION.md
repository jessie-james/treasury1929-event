## Application Limitations & Constraints

### 1. Booking Limitations

- **Payment Required**: All bookings require immediate payment (no "hold" or "reserve" options)

- **Development Environment**: Current configuration optimized for development (not production-ready without deployment configuration)

### 3. Venue Management Limitations
