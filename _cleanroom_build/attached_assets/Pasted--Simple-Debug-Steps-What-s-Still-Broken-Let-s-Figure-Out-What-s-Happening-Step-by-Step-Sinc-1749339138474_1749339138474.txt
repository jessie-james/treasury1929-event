# Simple Debug Steps - What's Still Broken?

## Let's Figure Out What's Happening Step by Step

Since the fix didn't work, we need to check what's actually happening. Please ask your Replit agent to run these simple tests:

## Step 1: Is Your Server Actually Running?

```bash
# Check if anything is running on port 5000
curl http://localhost:5000/health 2>/dev/null || echo "Nothing running on 5000"

# Check what's actually running
ps aux | grep node | grep -v grep
```

**Expected:** Should show your server running  
**If not:** Server didn't start properly

## Step 2: Can You Access the Success Page Directly?

```bash
# Test the success page directly (not through Stripe)
curl -I http://localhost:5000/booking-success
```

**Expected:** Should return "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"  
**If 403:** The route is still blocked somehow  
**If connection refused:** Server isn't running

## Step 3: What Does Your Browser Actually Show?

When you get the error, please tell me:

1. **What URL is in your browser address bar?** (the full localhost:XXXX/booking-success part)
2. **What's the EXACT error message?** (copy paste it)
3. **Is it the same "Se denegó el acceso" error or something different?**

## Step 4: Test the Simplest Possible Route

Ask your agent to add this super simple test route:

```javascript
// Add this to the very top of server/index.ts, before anything else
app.get('/test-simple', (req, res) => {
  res.send('<h1>THIS WORKS!</h1>');
});
```

Then test: `http://localhost:5000/test-simple`

**If this works:** The server is fine, something specific about booking-success is broken  
**If this fails:** The whole server setup has issues

## Step 5: Check Your Stripe URLs

```bash
# Find what URLs Stripe is actually using
grep -r "success_url\|cancel_url" server/ --include="*.ts" -A 1 -B 1
```

**Expected:** Should show `localhost:5000/booking-success`  
**If different:** URLs don't match your running server

## Step 6: Super Simple Questions

1. **Did you restart the server after making changes?**
2. **What port does your terminal say the server is running on?**
3. **Are you testing the same URL that Stripe redirects to?**

## Please Run These Tests and Tell Me:

- ✅ **What works** (server running? test route? direct access?)
- ❌ **What fails** (which step breaks?)
- 📝 **Exact error messages** you see

With this info, I can figure out exactly what's still broken and give you the right fix! 

Think of this like troubleshooting why the pizza delivery still isn't working - we need to check each step: Is the kitchen open? Is the address right? Is the delivery guy actually going to the right place? 🍕🔍
